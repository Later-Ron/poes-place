## Making a website

This is my first attempt at making a website on GitHub using a static site generator.

Maybe we should be looking at teaching these skills to other members of staff in the organisation.

Perhaps the files should be held on a USB PenDrive using git to manage version control?

Don't forget to Hugo before pushing the files to github (give it time to update)

Note: The cactus theme needs to be redownloaded everytime the repo is cloned.

What about google analytics?
